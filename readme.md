<h1>Waiter Web App</h1>
<hr/>

<p>Your sister is running a coffee shop in town, she needs a web application to help her schedule weekly waiter shifts.</p>

<p>This web application allows for waiters to:</p>

<ul>
	<li>login</li>
	<li>select days they can work</li>
	<li>update the days they can work on</li>
</ul>

<p>This web application allows for your sister to:</p>
<ul>
	<li>see how many waiters are available to work</li>
	<li>reset the data to use the system for a new week</li>
</ul>

<p>She need 3 waiters for each day. Days for which there are enough waiters should be marked as green, days for which more waiters are needed still and days that are over subscribed should be highlighted accordingly.</p>

<p>This the Admin Panel that your sister will see, has a coloured panel highlighting which days has enough waiters (<span style="color:green">green</span>), more than enough (<span style="color:'orange'">orange</span>) or not enough waiters (<span style="color:'maroon'">red</span>).
