## About Waiter App
- This Waiter App allows managers to keep track of waiters' weekly work days schedule.

- Managers can sign-up and login to see an Admin dashboard that will display on which days waiters are available to work. These days will be colored accordingly:

- Green - For days there's enough waiters scheduled.
- Orange - For days where there are not enough waiters scheduled.
- Red - For days that there are too much waiters scheduled.

- Waiters can sign-up and login and update the days they're available to work for the week.

- Managers can also reset the data for a starting of a new week.
