## Setting Up Development Environment
##### You will require the following:
- NodeJS
- ExpressJS
- Express Session
- Mongoose
- Express Handlebars
- Body Parser
- Express Flash Messages
- Cookie Parser
- MongoDB
- Mocha
- Nodemon

---

##### NodeJS
1. To check if you have NodeJS installed on your local machine run this command in the terminal - `node -v`

2. If this command fails, install Nodejs on your machine - <a href="">NodeJS Installation</a>

---

##### NPM Install
1. To install the modules used in this app run the following command in the terminal:
  ```
  npm install
  ```
2. This will install the node_modules such required and specified in the `package.json` file within the cloned repository.

---

##### MongoDB
1. Install <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-secure-mongodb-on-ubuntu-16-04"> MongoDB</a> (Note that this is for ubuntu-16-04    distributions)

2. After mongodb is set up go to your terminal and run `mongod` command. This will start-up and run the mongo server. To verify that the mongo process is running run the following command:
 ```
 ps -ef | grep mongo
 ```

3. In a new terminal window or tab, run the following command `mongo`, this command will open MongoDB's shell. You should be seeing something like this:

4. Now we can view all our databases in mongo by using the command `show dbs`. We can now locate and see our waiter_app database.

  ![screenshot-waiter-dbs](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22448019/29773458-e7ce0edc-8bfd-11e7-90b3-736d9cd72b7d.png)

5. You can open that database by entering `use waiter_app` command.

6. To view what the collections that are in this database use `show collections` command. You should now be seeing a collection called *admins* and *waiters*.

![waiter_collections](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22448019/29773717-e4f6b9a6-8bfe-11e7-84da-58e050c0e628.png)

7. To find all the waiters within this collection use the following command:
```
db.waiters.find({});
```

8. To add a new waiter to the database you can run the following command:
```
db.waiters.insert({waiter_username: 'JohnR', waiter_name: 'John', waiter_surname: 'Russ', waiter_password: 'jr@123'});
``` 

9. Running the app will save all data in a database called `waiter_app`.

##### Mocha
1. Install Mocha by running the following command in the terminal:
  ```
  npm install -g mocha
  ```
2. Alternatively if you want to install mocha locally that it can only be accessed within a certain path, run this command:
  ```
  npm install --save-dev mocha
  ```

3.  Now in your cloned repository you can run the `mocha` command to be able to run the tests.

See: <a href="https://mochajs.org/">Mocha</a>

##### Nodemon

1. Nodemon will watch files in your directory and if any changes happens nodemon will restart the node application without you having to do it manually.

in your paths.
```
npm install nodemon -g
```
- Alternatively if you want to install nodemon locally in a directory or path only, you can run the following command:
```
npm install --save-dev nodemon
```

---
##### Running Application
1. To run the app in the cloned repository run the following command: `nodemon index.js`

2. The express server will start running and in the terminal you can find on which port the application should be running, in this case, should be at port `5000`
